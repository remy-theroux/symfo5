## Quality

We use a code style tool named [PHP code sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).

You can detect code style issues and fix some of them automatically. All rules are defined in the phpcs.xml file.
Configuration reference and all rules can be found [here](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Customisable-Sniff-Properties) 

```bash
composer cs-check
